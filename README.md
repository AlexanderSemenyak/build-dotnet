    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:

**FYI:**
- Unit testing code coverage would need to be set in the csproj or an ``Directory.Build.props`` file of the project that contains unit tests with these set:
  - ``<CollectCoverage>true</CollectCoverage>``
  - ``<CoverletOutputFormat>opencover</CoverletOutputFormat>`` (or any other output format required by the service where the coverage reports get reported to)
  - ``<CoverletOutput>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)</CoverletOutput>``
- When wanting to include symbols in an symbols package set these as well in the csproj or an ``Directory.Build.props`` file of the project:
  - ``<IncludeSymbols>true</IncludeSymbols>``
  - ``<SymbolPackageFormat>snupkg</SymbolPackageFormat>``
- When the project being built is set to generate package on build, the PACK option on this action must be disabled.
