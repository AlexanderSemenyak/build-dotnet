## Inputs

Input | Default Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
SOLUTION_FILE_PATH | | Filepath of the solution of which contains all the projects to be packed, relative to root of repository
PACKAGE_PATH | | Path to store all generated nuget packages, relative to root of repository
TEST | `false` | Flag to toggle running unit tests for the projects built, disabled by default
PACK | `true` | Flag to toggle packing the projects built, enabled by default

**FYI:**
- Unit testing code coverage would need to be set in the csproj or an ``Directory.Build.props`` file of the project that contains unit tests with these set:
  - ``<CollectCoverage>true</CollectCoverage>``
  - ``<CoverletOutputFormat>opencover</CoverletOutputFormat>`` (or any other output format required by the service where the coverage reports get reported to)
  - ``<CoverletOutput>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)</CoverletOutput>``
- When wanting to include symbols in an symbols package set these as well in the csproj or an ``Directory.Build.props`` file of the project:
  - ``<IncludeSymbols>true</IncludeSymbols>``
  - ``<SymbolPackageFormat>snupkg</SymbolPackageFormat>``
- When the project being built is set to generate package on build, the PACK option on this action must be disabled.
